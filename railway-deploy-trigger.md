# Railway Deployment Trigger

This file is used to trigger Railway redeployments when needed.

**Last Update**: 2025-06-15 14:47 UTC  
**Reason**: Force redeploy after fixing ApifyApi constructor issue  
**Status**: Railway should detect this change and redeploy with latest server.js  

## Current Issues Fixed:
- ✅ ApifyApi import corrected (no destructuring)
- ✅ Environment variables configured  
- ✅ Enhanced error handling added
- ✅ CORS configuration updated

Railway should now deploy the correct version of server.js with proper ApifyApi constructor.
